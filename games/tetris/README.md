# Tetris

<!-- ![Tetris](images/tetris.png) -->

The Tetris project is a JavaScript application designed to provide a fun and interactive gaming experience while practicing object-oriented programming concepts. It recreates the classic Tetris game and incorporates a gamification system to enhance the gameplay.

## Features

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: The application faithfully recreates the addictive gameplay of the original Tetris game, where players must arrange falling blocks to create complete lines.

- **Gamification System**: The project incorporates a gamification system that includes scoring, levels, and a progress indicator to provide a rewarding gaming experience.

## How It's Made

The Tetris project is built using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript is the primary programming language used to implement the game logic, including block movement, collision detection, scoring, and level management.

- **HTML**: The HTML structure defines the layout of the Tetris game interface and provides the necessary elements for rendering the game grid and statistics.

- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: CSS Grid and Flexbox are utilized to create a responsive and dynamic game board layout, ensuring proper alignment and positioning of the Tetris elements.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of the Tetris project, several valuable lessons were learned, including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing Tetris using object-oriented programming concepts improved code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developing the game logic, including block movement, rotation, collision detection, and line clearing, required understanding and application of complex algorithms and data structures.

- **User Interaction and Event Handling**: Handling user input, such as keyboard controls, and managing events in real-time added a level of interactivity to the game and improved the overall user experience.

## Optimizations

To optimize the Tetris project and improve its performance and user experience, the following techniques can be applied:

- **Game Speed Adjustment**: Implementing a dynamic game speed adjustment based on the player's level or score can provide a more challenging and engaging gameplay experience.

- **Optimized Rendering**: Optimizing the rendering process by utilizing techniques like canvas rendering or requestAnimationFrame can improve the game's performance, especially when dealing with complex animations and a large number of elements.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring the game is fully responsive and playable on different screen sizes and mobile devices can expand the audience and enhance accessibility.

## Usage

To play Tetris, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tetris.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move and rotate the falling Tetris blocks.

4. Aim to complete horizontal lines by arranging the blocks strategically. When a line is completed, it will be cleared, and you will earn points.

5. Reach higher levels by accumulating points and enjoy the challenging gameplay as the speed increases.
